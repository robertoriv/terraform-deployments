# terraform-deployments

This repository is designed to showcase a few terraform deployment strategies:
- A simple deployment using a single folder (technically-speaking a module) (`deployments/simple`)
- A more deployment that uses a more scalable folder structure (`deployments/live`)
- A deployment using terragrunt (`deployments/terragrunt`)
